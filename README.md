**First Steps in Front-End Development**
The files in this repository represent my initial steps in learning web development. Each HTML file is a small yet significant milestone as I dive into creating interactive and user-friendly interfaces. Below are the foundational pages I built:

Create Customer.html: A form for creating a new customer account, showcasing the basics of form handling and validation.
Customer List Screen.html: A simple yet effective layout to display customer details, offering a glimpse into table structures and data representation.
Login.html: A basic login page, introducing the concepts of authentication and user sessions.
These pages may be elementary, but they represent the first steps of an exciting journey in full-stack web development. I hope this inspires others to take their first leap into coding â€” every small project contributes to a larger skill set!
