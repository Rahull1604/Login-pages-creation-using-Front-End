## First Steps in Front-End Development ðŸš€

The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and these HTML pages mark the start of my exciting adventure into front-end development. Each file is a foundational piece of the puzzle, crafted during my learning process. These pages might be simple, but they represent significant learning moments.

- **Create Customer.html**: A basic customer creation form that introduces form handling, input validation, and user data entry concepts.
- **Customer List Screen.html**: A simple customer list interface that demonstrates how data can be structured and presented in a clean, organized way.
- **Login.html**: A minimalistic login page that touches on user authentication basics, laying the groundwork for future dynamic functionality.

These projects are just the beginning. Every piece of code, no matter how small, brings me closer to mastering full-stack development. I hope these early efforts encourage others who are just starting to dive into web development. Remember, no project is too small when you're learning â€” every line of code builds towards something greater.
